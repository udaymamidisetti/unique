        <h4>About Cookies</h4>
        <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that
          can be placed on your computer or mobile device that uniquely
          identifies your browser or device. We may use technologies like
          cookies, pixels, and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand
          products, services, and ads.
        </p>
        <h4>What are cookies used for?</h4>
        <p>
          Cookies and other technologies allow a site or services to know if
          your computer or device has visited it before. These technologies can
          then be used to deliver products, services, and ads, help us
          understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate
          between pages efficiently, help us remember your preferences, and
          generally improve your experience in using our services. Cookies can
          also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and
          your interests.
        </p>
        <h4>What will happen If you turn off cookies completely?</h4>
        <p>
          Overall, cookies are safe, as they only identify your computer and
          mobile to customize your Web and App experience. Accepting a cookie
          does not provide us access to your computer, mobile or any Personally
          Identifiable Information about you, other than the information you
          choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, nor can they be used
          to deliver a virus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust
          yours (i.e. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Google
          Chrome) to notify you of cookie placement requests, refuse certain
          cookies, or decline cookies completely. If you turn off cookies
          completely, there may be some features of the Site and App that will
          not be available to you, and some Web pages and App pages may not
          display properly.

        <h4>Why does MY STATUS use cookies and similar technologies?</h4>
        <p>
          We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to
          show you relevant content, improve your experience, and help protect
          MY STATUS and our users. We may use these technologies to deliver the
          service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to
          move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure
          areas, and store information so that MY STATUS responds faster. We may
          use these technologies to collect information about how you use the
          Service, for example which pages you go to most often and whether you
          get error messages from certain pages. We may use these technologies
          to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name,
          language or the region you're in) and tailor the Service to provide
          enhanced features and content for you. These cookies can also be used
          to remember changes you've made to text size, font, and other parts of
          pages that you can customize. MY STATUS or our advertising partners
          may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to
          your interests. These technologies can remember that your device has
          visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's
          browsing activity on other sites or services other than MY STATUS.
          This information may be shared with organizations outside MY STATUS,
          such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the
          advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising
          campaign. *We may use these technologies to understand, improve, and
          research products and services.
        </p>
        <h4>How long will cookies stay on my device?</h4>
        <p>
          The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile
          device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie.
          Session cookies will only stay on your device until you close your
          browser. Persistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device
          until they expire or are deleted.
        </p>
        <h4>First- and third-party cookies</h4>
        <p>
          First-party cookies are cookies that belong to MY STATUS. Third-party
          cookies are cookies that another party places on your device through
          our Service. Third-party cookies may be placed on your device by
          someone providing advertising, measurement, marketing, and analytics
          services to MY STATUS, or to provide certain features and improve our
          services for you. For example, other companies’ cookies can help us
          understand how our service is being used. Third-party cookies may also
          be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use
          them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the
          Internet, to measure the performance and effectiveness of those ads,
          and to support marketing and analytics.
